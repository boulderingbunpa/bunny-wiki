## living space

- LENAST Waterproof mattress protector, 38x75" for floor if bunny is not potty trained.   https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/lenast-waterproof-mattress-protector-40448296/
- SONGMICS Pet Playpen (SONGMICS has a variety on Amazon). The primary useful components are the "Plastic Panel (17.7″ x 13.8″)" for the main walls, use at least 3x3 walls for 1 bunny. A "Metal Grid (17.7″ x 13.8″)" wall panel can be used also which allows tieing in water bottle feeder. I don't use panels for the floor, using the mattress covers instead   https://www.amazon.com/SONGMICS-Playpen-Exercise-Enclosure-ULPC004W01/dp/B0861PV8L1/
- "Large bunny litter box" (multiple brands sell this one, the distinguishing feature are high walls, and a 9x13 floor grid) Search around on Amazon to find the cheapest one at the time, should be $30-40  https://www.amazon.com/CalPalmy-X-Large-Chinchilla-Galesaur-Animals/dp/B085VQ64L3/
- Litter. You should place newspaper/recycling paper on the bottom of the box to make it easier to clean. Then place absorbent litter on top of the paper. Just buy a cheap, non-toxic, neutralizing odor one. E.g.  https://www.amazon.com/Kaytee-Clean-Bedding-White-Liters/dp/B007R6G8JW/
- HEMMABAK Loaf pan, gray, 1.9 qt, for hay feeder. Can put one of these also on the toilet box, since bunnies like to eat while pooping. https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/hemmabak-loaf-pan-gray-30456692/
- LÄTTUGGAD Snack container, set of 2, stainless steel. I use it to feed water and pellets  https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/laettuggad-snack-container-set-of-2-stainless-steel-20498918/
- SAMLA series. I use it to store hay  https://www.ikea.com/us/en/cat/samla-series-12553/

## food

Young rabbits (older than 6 weeks, younger than 6 months):
- Alfalfa hay (95% of diet with pellets)
- Alfalfa pellets (~1/2 cup a day)
- Treats (5% of diet)

- Supreme Petfoods 3 Pack of Selective Naturals Woodland Loops Guinea Pig Treats, 2.8 Ounces each, with Dandelion and Rosehip.  A favorite for my bunnies. https://www.amazon.com/Supreme-Selective-Naturals-Woodland-Loops/dp/B07SKY1JVQ/

Treats: avoid things that obviously have too much sugar. Like yogurt drops.

An-Jan Bay Area stores are great to buy rabbit food and materials. They have things on sale in bulk (hay, pellets), but you have to ask them (not on the showroom floor). It's much cheaper if you buy these in bulk. These come from their behind-the-store warehouse. Sometimes, I've had termites from the warehouse goods. Due to this, you should quartine the warehouse products somewhere in your house (e.g. plastic storage garbage can).

## training

### toilet training basics

When your bunny pees outside the box, soak it up with a tissue and place it inside the box. Over time she will associate peeing with the box. Can also put her poops into there. It might help to put the box in one of the corners of her area.

If you see a cecotrope (wet poop):
1. if it's really fresh/you saw it just came out, you can get a tissue and pick it up and try to feed it to her
2. if you don't know if it's fresh, use a tissue and pick it up and throw it in the trash
